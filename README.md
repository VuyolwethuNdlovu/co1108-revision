# # CO1108 Quick Revision

For my second year at University of Leicester, we were given the assignment to create revision materials for our first year modules to help future first year students.

Me and 2 other peers decided to create a website dedicated to the CO1108 - Foundations of Computation module.

I (Vuyolwethu Ndlovu), was in charge of developing the website whereas my peers created the content , the youtube videos and the revision questions.

I mainly used Bootstrap to help with the UI and  JavaScript for the Hide and Show elements in the website.
